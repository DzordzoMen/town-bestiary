# Town bestiary

## Description

Once again as "Śpiące Wydry" we have taken part in another edition of SheepYouHack. We've made an app called "Town bestiary" that helps solve the problem of sharing urban spaces with wild animals. We want to raise public awareness to make metropolises nature-friendly so that we and our animals can feel at home in them.
